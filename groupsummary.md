Description:
	A lightweight front-end for displaying information from Blizzard's StarCraft II API that users can request. The goals were:
*To figure out how to query Blizzard's API and store the results in our database
*To create a front-end to display that information to the user
*To effectively implement database storage and retrieval of information

Goals Achieved:
*We mostly figured out how Blizzard's API worked and we got a thorough, albeit ultimately untested, implementation of a system to communicate with it
*We finished implementing procedures and database queries that would add and retrieve relevant information to our database

Goals Not Achieved:
*The front-end itself is an absolute mess, and it's far from complete.
*There are a number of errors in our code that we haven't managed to fix.

There is plenty of potential for future work - we can implement additional featuers to the API and finish the front end, as well as cleaning up the code we already have and ironing out the errors.
